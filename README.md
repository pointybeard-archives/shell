# Symphony Shell

- Version: 1.0.2
- Author: Alistair Kearney (hi@alistairkearney.com)
- Build Date: 3rd April 2015
- Requirements: Symphony 2.6 or greater


The Symphony Shell extension is a framework that allows commands to run from the command line. Commands
are scripts provided by this and/or other extensions. See bin/test for an example.

Developers can include commands in their extensions, allowing for operations not suited
to web servers. The command API gives access to Symphony core framework, including Database, Config, Log
etc.

## INSTALLATION

1. Upload the 'shell' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.
2. Enable it by selecting the "Shell", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

### Optional Steps
1. Run the following to make the `symphony` script executable: `chmod +x extensions/shell/bin/symphony`
2. Add the `extensions/shell/bin/symphony` path to your `PATH` environment variable or create
    a symbolic link to it in a location that resides in the `PATH` e.g. /usr/local/sbin. This will
    enable you to run the command `symphony` without preceding path information.


## USAGE

From the shell, you can run the following command

    php -f /path/to/extensions/shell/bin/symphony -- [args]

For usage information, use `--usage`. E.G.

    php -f /path/to/extensions/shell/bin/symphony -- --usage

or, if you followed the optional steps above, just

    symphony --usage
