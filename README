Symphony Shell
------------------------------------

Version: 0.1 (alpha build)
Author: Alistair Kearney (alistair@symphony-cms.com)
Build Date: 13th July 2009
Requirements: Symphony 2.0.7 or greater


The Symphony Shell extension is a framework that allows commands to run from the command line. Commands 
are scripts provided by this and/or other extensions. See bin/test for an example.

Developers will be able to include commands in their extensions, allowing for operations not suited
to web servers. The command API gives access to Symphony core framework, including Database, Config, Log
etc.



[INSTALLATION]

** Note: The latest version can alway be grabbed with "git clone git://github.com/symphony/shell.git"

1. Upload the 'shell' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "Shell", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.




3.1 (Optional) Edit /extensions/shell/bin/symphony, setting the very first line as the path to the PHP executable. E.G.	

	#!/usr/bin/php
	
3.2 Run the following command to make 'symphony' executable

	chmod +x extensions/shell/bin/symphony	
	
3.3 Either add the path to extensions/shell/bin/symphony to your PATH environment variable or create a 
	symbolic link to it in a location that resides in the PATH. This will enable you to run the command 'symphony' without
	preceding path information.



[USAGE]

From the shell, you can run the following command

	php -f /path/to/extensions/shell/bin/symphony -- [args]
	
If you followed step 3.1 and 3.2, you can forego the 'php -f' part. Following 3.3 will allow you to ignore the path as well.

For usage information, use --usage. E.G.

	php -f /path/to/extensions/shell/bin/symphony -- --usage
	
or, depending on your setup, just

	symphony --usage
	
	
[TODO]

	- Streamline the installation process
	- Make the README clearer
